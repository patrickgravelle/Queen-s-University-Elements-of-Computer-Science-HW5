# Queen's University Elements of Computer Science HW5

## About

The fifth assignment of the undergraduate level course "CISC 101 - Elements of Computer Science" at Queen's University, taught by Dr. Alan McLeod, in the Winter Semester of 2017.

## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to write several functions in Python that are able to sort and summarize a large weather statistics dataset containing data from 1938 to 2012. The program sorts the data in order of year and month, while providing mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, along with monthly precipitation values both in rain and snow. Additionally, there is a search feature built in to allow the user to find the rainfall of any month from any year. Finally, results are presented following this search of the highest and lowest monthly temperatures, snowfalls, and rainfalls, followed by annual highs, lows, and medians for snowfall and temperature.
